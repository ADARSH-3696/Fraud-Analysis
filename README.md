# Fraud-Analysis
Here I am using a python Library SequenceMatcher for matching one email id from the other email id To check the percentage of matching of one to the other 
Before doing that I have split the email into two parts from ( @ ) so that the matching result be accurate 
And Lastly I have made another list of email who matches more than 60% to the other email's 
So that as a result we have a list of email's that matches more than 60% to the other email's
